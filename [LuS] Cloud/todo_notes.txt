	Since we have !modpower with !ulti for Admins+, do we still need !ulti itself or should we remove it from lua2.lua?
DarkOrbit
	Well If it's still gonna work with admins+ then i guess i dont know why we'd need it for lua2.lua :P
SxDarkOne:
	Well, about "need it for lua2.lua", once lus.lua(+modules) has something that's in lua2.lua, we'll remove it from lua2.lua (the one in the dropbox ofcourse). This way we can see what else we need to move.
	This means that at the end lua2.lua will nog get used anymore =p
DarkOrbit:
	Umm.... well is it still gonna work then?
SxDarkOne:
	As for the bombers, we can just leave them as a seperate file for now. If Jade every comes online I'll talk to her if she wants to convert it to a lus module. Last time I talked to her she did say something about fixing some things
	in the bombers.
DarkOrbit:
	Sounds good. I'm sure it could be improved code.
SxDarkOne:
	Ehh O_O Do you mind if I tackle the RandomMessages? Going through 141+ If/elseif's every time an object is created is a waste of resources imho :x
DarkOrbit:
	TACKLE!?!? YOU MEAN REMOVE THEM!?!?!?!?!?! Nooooo we should keep them. They are fun!! Otherwise make it on a timer or something and randomly select one of them. But I like the way it is now xD
SxDarkOne:
	Why, when attaching the damagescript, do you check for this preset?: "CnC_Ignatio_Mobius_Skirmish"
DarkOrbit:
	That is on the tesla tower... so people dont mass damage points
SxDarkOne:
	Mind if we remove the "version" message when someone joins? It's a line less when a player joins. Sometimes it's really annoying having alot of message when someone joins.
	I also made some of the LuS message from msg to ppage to prevent teh spam.
DarkOrbit:
	That's fine with me.
SxDarkOne:
	customs.lua -> Isn't needed to be put in the LuaPlugins folder, because it doesn't do anything? I assume it's only for info? Or am I wrong?
DarkOrbit:
	Those are for use with bombers i think. 
SxDarkOne:
	Maybe it's just me being a pain-in-the-ass perfectionist, but maybe it's an idea to make the weapon buy messages more consistant? =o
DarkOrbit:
	what?
SxDarkOne:
	When converting !all, I found that the !pic was in there twice. I removed the double one. There is also a difference in the !rocket name, one has a CnC_ prefix (in !rocket), the other one doesn't (in !all).
	!ramjet was in there twice too (POW_RamjetRifle_Player), removed the double one.
	It also doesn't have !megarepair (CnC_POW_RepairGun_Player), !repair (POW_RepairGun_Player), !shotgun (POW_Shotgun_Player), !remote (CnC_POW_MineRemote_02)
	!technopack also has a different weapon name for volt (CnC_POW_VoltAutoRifle_Player_Nod instead of POW_VoltAutoRifle_Player)
	
	20 Buy-able weapons (21 if you count the extra volt auto rifle), 19 in !all currently, but 4 are missing, so there's 4 different ones in !all O_o I think I found two:
	POW_Pistol_Player and POW_Pistol_AI
	
	If you buy every weapon seperate, thus not using !all, it will cost 17 000 max without !technopack. !all is 20 000. Maybe add a refill to !all just like !technopack? then it would be 1k cheaper to use !all =o
	
	Was all above intended? If not, could you fix it. because I honestly don't know much about LevelEdit and preset names and stuff like that xD
DarkOrbit:
	you can just remove !all alltogether. It was more useful back when banks were unlimited. It's basically pointless now. 
SxDarkOne:
	Meh, a test this weekend isn't needed. Lets just wait 2 more weeks. I think we'll have most of the stuff in lus then.
DarkOrbit:
	You da man!
